    "## Making training mini-batches\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where we'll make our mini-batches for training. Remember that we want our batches to be multiple sequences of some desired number of sequence steps. Considering a simple example, our batches would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/sequence_batching@1x.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We have our text encoded as integers as one long array in `encoded`. Let's create a function that will give us an iterator for our batches. I like using [generator functions](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/) to do this. Then we can pass `encoded` into this function and get our batch generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is discard some of the text so we only have completely full batches. Each batch contains $N \\times M$ characters, where $N$ is the batch size (the number of sequences) and $M$ is the number of steps. Then, to get the number of batches we can make from some array `arr`, you divide the length of `arr` by the batch size. Once you know the number of batches and the batch size, you can get the total number of characters to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need to split `arr` into $N$ sequences. You can do this using `arr.reshape(size)` where `size` is a tuple containing the dimensions sizes of the reshaped array. We know we want $N$ sequences (`n_seqs` below), let's make that the size of the first dimension. For the second dimension, you can use `-1` as a placeholder in the size, it'll fill up the array with the appropriate data for you. After this, you should have an array that is $N \\times (M * K)$ where $K$ is the number of batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this array, we can iterate through it to get our batches. The idea is each batch is a $N \\times M$ window on the array. For each subsequent batch, the window moves over by `n_steps`. We also want to create both the input and target arrays. Remember that the targets are the inputs shifted over one character. You'll usually see the first input character used as the last target character, so something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y[:, :-1], y[:, -1] = x[:, 1:], x[:, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `x` is the input batch and `y` is the target batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I like to do this window is use `range` to take steps of size `n_steps` from $0$ to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of steps in each sequence. That way, the integers you get from `range` always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `n_steps` wide."

    "\n",
    "> ## Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Monitoring Validation Loss vs. Training Loss\n",
    ">If you're somewhat new to Machine Learning or Neural Networks it can take a bit of expertise to get good models. The most important quantity to keep track of is the difference between your training loss (printed during training) and the validation loss (printed once in a while when the RNN is run on the validation data (by default every 1000 iterations)). In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - If your training loss is much lower than validation loss then this means the network might be **overfitting**. Solutions to this are to decrease your network size, or to increase dropout. For example you could try dropout of 0.5 and so on.\n",
    "> - If your training/validation loss are about equal then your model is **underfitting**. Increase the size of your model (either number of layers or the raw number of neurons per layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Approximate number of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "> The two most important parameters that control the model are `lstm_size` and `num_layers`. I would advise that you always use `num_layers` of either 2/3. The `lstm_size` can be adjusted based on how much data you have. The two important quantities to keep track of here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The number of parameters in your model. This is printed when you start training.\n",
    "> - The size of your dataset. 1MB file is approximately 1 million characters.\n",
    "\n",
    ">These two should be about the same order of magnitude. It's a little tricky to tell. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - I have a 100MB dataset and I'm using the default parameter settings (which currently print 150K parameters). My data size is significantly larger (100 mil >> 0.15 mil), so I expect to heavily underfit. I am thinking I can comfortably afford to make `lstm_size` larger.\n",
    "> - I have a 10MB dataset and running a 10 million parameter model. I'm slightly nervous and I'm carefully monitoring my validation loss. If it's larger than my training loss then I may want to try to increase dropout a bit and see if that helps the validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Best models strategy\n",
    "\n",
    ">The winning strategy to obtaining very good models (if you have the compute time) is to always err on making the network larger (as large as you're willing to wait for it to compute) and then try different dropout values (between 0,1). Whatever model has the best validation performance (the loss, written in the checkpoint filename, low is good) is the one you should use in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It is very common in deep learning to run many different models with many different hyperparameter settings, and in the end take whatever checkpoint gave the best validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">By the way, the size of your training and validation splits are also parameters. Make sure you have a decent amount of data in your validation set or otherwise the validation performance will be noisy and not very informative."
